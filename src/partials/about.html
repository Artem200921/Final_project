        Commercial ice cream is made by combining, under constant agitation, the
        liquid ingredients (milk, cream, syrups, etc.). These liquids are heated
        and combined with dry ingredients (sugar, stabilizers, dried eggs or
        milk) to form a mix, which is then pasteurized and homogenized. The mix
        is ripened for several hours in a refrigerated vat, then combined with
        finely chopped fruit, nuts, or other solids. The mix is agitated while
        being frozen in order to incorporate air and control the size of the ice
        crystals that are formed. The partially frozen ice cream is drawn off
        into packages and frozen solid, or “hardened.” So-called soft-service
        ice cream was invented in 1939; it is served directly from the freezing
        machine without being allowed to harden.
