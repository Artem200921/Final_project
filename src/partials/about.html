          Commercial ice cream is made by combining, under constant agitation,
          the liquid ingredients (milk, cream, syrups, etc.). These liquids are
          heated and combined with dry ingredients (sugar, stabilizers, dried
          eggs or milk) to form a mix, which is then pasteurized and
          homogenized. The mix is ripened for several hours in a refrigerated
          vat, then combined with finely chopped fruit, nuts, or other solids.
          The mix is agitated while being frozen in order to incorporate air and
          control the size of the ice crystals that are formed. The partially
          frozen ice cream is drawn off into packages and frozen solid, or
          “hardened.” So-called soft-service ice cream was invented in 1939; it
          is served directly from the freezing machine without being allowed to
          harden
